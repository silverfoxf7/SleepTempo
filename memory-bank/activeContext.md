# SleepTempo Development Status

## Current Progress
We have successfully implemented the core audio engine, the tempo-ladder sequencer, and the minimal user interface, following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach where applicable:

1. **Test Infrastructure**: Completed.
2. **Audio Engine**: Core logic implemented (`src/lib/audioEngine.ts`) and unit tests passing (except skipped jitter test).
3. **Sequencer**: Core logic implemented (`src/lib/sequencerManager.ts`) and unit tests passing.
4. **Minimal UI**: Implemented in `src/app/page.tsx`:
   * Dark theme, full-viewport layout.
   * Circular Start/Stop button.
   * Visual feedback (pulsing dot) when playing.
5. **UI State Management**: Implemented `src/lib/usePlayer.ts` hook:
   * Manages `isPlaying` state.
   * Connects UI actions (button click, spacebar) to `SequencerManager`.
   * Handles `onSequenceEnd` callback from the sequencer.
6. **Keyboard Control**: Spacebar toggles playback.

## Next Steps
- **Option 1 (Optional Features):** Proceed with Step 5 (Settings Drawer) or Step 6 (Soft Voice Count).
- **Option 2 (Core Polish):** Proceed with Step 7 (PWA / Offline-First) and Step 8 (E2E/Manual Testing).
- **Option 3 (Infrastructure):** Proceed with Step 9 (CI/CD) and Step 10 (Docs).

## TDD Pattern Being Followed
1. ✅ **Spec-Writer (Planner)**: Create failing tests (Completed for AudioEngine & SequencerManager).
2. ✅ **Impl-Writer (Coder)**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass (Completed for AudioEngine & SequencerManager).
3. ⏳ **Refactorer**: Optional cleanup (Skipped for now).

Commits follow `spec:` and `feat:` prefixes.
