# SleepTempo Development Status

## Current Progress
We have successfully implemented the core audio engine and passed the associated unit tests, following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach:

1. **Test Infrastructure**: Completed.
2. **Audio Engine Tests**: All required functionality tests (singleton, start/stop, scheduling, cancellation, onEnded) are implemented and passing (except for jitter precision test, which remains skipped).
3. **Audio Engine Implementation**: Core logic in `src/lib/audioEngine.ts` is implemented to pass the tests, including:
   * Singleton pattern.
   * Click buffer generation.
   * Look-ahead scheduling using `setTimeout` and `AudioContext` timing.
   * Handling of `TempoStep` sequences.
   * Correct `start`, `stop`, and `onEnded` behavior.
   * Robust mocking setup using `vi.stubGlobal` and dynamic imports in tests.

## Next Steps
- **Option 1 (Refactor):** Perform an optional refactoring pass on `src/lib/audioEngine.ts` to improve clarity or efficiency while ensuring all tests remain green.
- **Option 2 (Proceed):** Move to **Step 3 - Tempo-Ladder Sequencer**:
   - Create `constants.ts`.
   - Begin the **Spec-Writer** phase for the `SequencerManager` by creating failing tests.

## TDD Pattern Being Followed
1. ✅ **Spec-Writer (Planner)**: Create failing tests (Completed for AudioEngine).
2. ✅ **Impl-Writer (Coder)**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass (Completed for AudioEngine core).
3. ⏳ **Refactorer**: Optional cleanup (Potential next step).

Commits follow `spec:` and `feat:` prefixes.
